Add a carousel to your website. Based on the Owl Carousel, a responsive and fully customizable carousel.

== Description ==

Add a carousel to your website. Based on the Owl Carousel, a responsive and fully customizable carousel.

Special thanks to Bartosz Wojciechowski, Owl Carousel developer.

#### Features ####

* Image slide
* HTML slide
* Wordpress Gallery compatible
* [NEW!] Slide link
* And of course, all the Owl Carousel options!

#### How to use ####
1. Create a new Category
2. Create new slides
3. Include your carousel in any content (post, page, theme...)

You can add your carousel into any post with the following shortcode (or using the custom TinyMCE button):

[owl-carousel]
To edit the carousel options (items per slide, auto play...) you just need to add options in the shortcode:

[owl-carousel category="Uncategorized" items="1" autoPlay="true" itemsDesktop="1000,2"]
Notice the category option to display items from a specific category and also the itemsDesktop without the brackets (because it's not possible to include brackets within a Wordpress shortcode).

You can also use the default Wordpress gallery like this (you need to enable this feature in the plugin's parameters):

[gallery ids="48,47,46,45,44", items="3"]

If you want to include Owl Carousel in your custom theme, please have a look at the do_shortcode Wordpress function:

You can checkout the available options on the Owl carousel website:

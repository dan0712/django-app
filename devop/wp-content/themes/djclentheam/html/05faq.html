<li>Your advisor fee on top of the platform fee (up to 125 bps).</li>
<li>The expenses for the underlying low-cost ETFs, which are paid out of dividends.</li>
</ol>

<p>For transfers greater than $300,000, we can provide wire transfers. Clients can access the wire instructions within the client experience. There is no fee from Betterment for wires, but clients should check with their bank for any applicable fees they may have.</p>
<p>During the signup process we will create an electronic link between a client’s existing checking account and their investment account. This electronic link makes it easy to transfer money whenever, for free. Once the link is set up, clients can make deposits and withdrawals on the Transfer tab.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Do we offer checks or wire transfers for withdrawals?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>

<p>Electronic deposits from a client’s bank to Betterment typically invest the following business day for deposits made before 11PM EST. This includes requests made on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Electronic withdrawals from Betterment to a client’s bank generally take 2-4 business days due to the required sale and settlement of securities. Note that withdrawal time may also be impacted if there have been recent deposits within the previous 5 business days.</p>
<p>Deposits must be initiated by 11PM EST to be invested by the next business day. Withdrawals must be initiated before the stock market closes at 4:00PM EST to be transacted that day.

<p>Selling shares is a taxable event—those sales could be triggered by a withdrawal or an allocation change. Tax Impact Preview shows the estimated gains and losses the sale is expected to realize, as well as an estimate of the taxes that may result, in real-time, before the transaction is carried out.</p>
<p>When entering a withdrawal amount on the Transfer tab or adjusting the allocation slider on the Advice tab, an “Estimate tax impact” button will appear, giving you access to a summary of the short- and long-term gains and losses expected to result from the sales.</p>
<p>Tax Impact Preview generates this estimate by “pre-playing” the transaction to simulate the trades that will take place across all of the ETFs that you hold.</p>
<p>To determine those trades, our algorithms first check whether each asset class is over or underweight by comparing your current allocation to your target allocation. The amount of bonds and stocks to sell is determined in a way that brings each asset class back to the portfolio’s target allocation.</p>
<p>Once the specific ETFs and amounts to sell have been determined, Betterment’s algorithms use the TaxMin accounting method to select the specific lots that will be sold. For each ETF, TaxMin selects losses first and short-term capital gains last in order to minimize the tax impacts.</p>
<p>Tax Impact Preview sums up all the losses and gains that are expected to be realized across the different ETFs and tax lots. If your losses outweigh your gains, Tax Impact Preview will estimate your realized losses. If your gains outweigh your losses, estimated taxes owed will be displayed.</p>
<p>The estimated tax is an upper bound, meaning it assumes the highest applicable tax rates of 39.6% federal, 13.3% state, 3.8% medicare surtax and deductibility of state taxes. Actual taxes are likely to be different depending on specific circumstances, including, but not limited to, the marginal tax rate applicable to you, any subsequent trading activity, the presence of other capital gains or losses for the year, and securities prices at the moment your execute the trades.</p>
<p>Tax Impact Preview is just an estimate, since it depends on the current prices of each ETF, which won’t necessarily be the price at the time you trade. However, it will give you a good idea of the impact of the transaction. Tax Impact Preview is not tax advice.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Who is eligible to use TLH+?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>Tax Loss Harvesting+ is available to all customers with a total account balance of $50,000 or greater, including the balance of both IRA and regular taxable accounts.</p>
<p>At the moment, we do not recommend that TLH+ be used by customers who have spouses that also have accounts, as TLH+ doesn&#8217;t currently factor in activity in a spouse&#8217;s account when optimizing around wash sales. However, we will have this functionality in the near future.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> How does TLH+ work with multiple goals?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>The way we’ve built goals to interact with tax lots, you and your clients get the best of both worlds. Goals give you an intuitive way to visualize savings in different buckets, with different allocations and horizons. They also provide ability to sell the most optimal lot available in the portfolio. So when harvesting runs, we look for losses across all goals.</p>
<p>When clients make withdrawals, we are looking for the most tax-efficient way to sell tax lots, from the entire portfolio (regardless of which goal you are withdrawing from). Think of it as a bunch of swapping that happens under the hood: for example, “Goal A” needs to sell some VTI for a withdrawal, but &#8220;Goal B&#8221;has a more tax-efficient lot of VTI to sell. TaxMin chooses to sell the “best” share of VTI from the entire portfolio. So when clients need to withdraw from short-term goals, we&#8217;ll select the most tax-efficient lots, from the entire portfolio.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Does TLH+ work with IRAs?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>Tax-advantaged retirement accounts, including Roth and Traditional IRAs, are already tax-free or tax-deferred, and it is not possible to harvest losses in these accounts to reduce taxes.</p>
<p>However, if you hold taxable and IRA accounts at Betterment, TLH+ does properly coordinate wash sale management across the accounts, guaranteeing that a harvested loss will never get permanently disallowed. This is a feature unique to TLH+.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Is TLH+ automatically enabled?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>For new or existing customers, clients will need to enable TLH+ from the Summary tab by clicking Get Started in the overview section. Once TLH+ is enabled, harvests will occur automatically according to our algorithm.</p>
<p>Note that TLH+ works across all goals. It is not goal specific.</div></div>

<p>We use the &#8220;direct rollover&#8221;method to prevent any withholding or negative tax consequences. A direct transfer entails a clients current provider sending us a check of the funds directly, for your clients benefit. To get started, you or your client can click &#8220;Rollover&#8221;at the top right hand side of your Summary page. You must answer a few questions, and receive an email with the full, personalized instructions, including how the check should be made out and where it should be sent, to complete your rollover. Please note that Traditional IRA funds must be rolled over into a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA funds must be rolled over into a Roth IRA. If you aren&#8217;t sure which type(s) of funds your clients have, contact the current provider or HR representative. You can always convert a Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA after the rollover.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Do you support Roth conversions?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>Anyone, regardless of income, is eligible to convert his or her Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. To do so, your clients can simply click on the gear symbol at the top right side of theirr Traditional IRA on the Summary page and choose “Convert IRA to Roth”. Note that clients will not see the option to do this until the Traditional IRA has been funded. The wizard will guide clients through the steps. If clients don&#8217;t yet have a Roth IRA account, this process will create one for them. If clients want to open a &#8220;Backdoor Roth&#8221;with Betterment, simply fund a Traditional IRA and convert the funds into Roth. Important things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conversions must be done before December 31st of the tax year.</li>
<li>Betterment does not withhold any taxes for you, because it reduces the amount of money that can grow tax-free in your Roth IRA.</li>
<li>Generally, any funds you convert from Traditional to Roth that were previously deducted will be subject to income tax. Since Betterment cannot provide specific tax advice, we recommend you consult a tax advisor and the IRS Publication 590.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that for clients who live in Michigan, there are <a href="http://support.betterment.com/customer/portal/articles/961552-i-live-in-michigan-why-are-there-special-requirements-for-me-" target="_blank">special requirements</a> for completing a conversion.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Can you undo Roth conversions?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>If you or your clients change their mind prior to paying your annual taxes and decide you do not want to convert your IRA, you have the option to do a recharacterization. This is a process that allows you to redefine all or part of the Roth IRA conversion as a contribution to a Traditional IRA. The typical deadline for a recharacterization is the due date of your tax return (normally April 15 of the year following the conversion, or October 15 if you file an extension). Clients should consult with a tax professional and the IRS Publication 590 about the specifics of your situation. Clients can undo a Roth conversion by clicking on the gear symbol at the top right hand side of their Roth IRA box the Summary page and clicking &#8220;Undo IRA Conversion&#8221;. Note: Once clients recharacterize a contribution, you cannot reconvert that amount to a Roth IRA before the beginning of the tax year following the initial conversion, or before 30 days after the day you recharacterized your contribution from a Roth IRA, whichever is later.</div><div class="tab"><i class="nt-icon-plus"></i><i class="nt-icon-minus"></i> Do you support inherited IRAs?</div><div class="pane clearfix"></p>
<p>Yes, clients can transfer an inherited retirement plan. The process is called a trustee-to-trustee transfer. Your client’s current provider will send us a check of the funds directly, for your client’s benefit. Please note that currently, we only allow one Traditional IRA and one Roth IRA per person. For example, if a client rolls over an Inherited Traditional IRA with Betterment, the client cannot set up another Traditional IRA with us. According to IRS rules, clients also will not be able to contribute further to their Inherited IRA at Betterment.</div></div>

<p>We do not help in the creation of a new trust. Trusts are legal entities and require the assistance of an estate attorney or financial planner to file paperwork with the proper authorities. We can open a trust account in the name of a trust that clients have already established.</div></div>

<p>We use a standard time-weighted return to calculate percentage returns for each goal on the Summary page, and to display returns over time on the Performance page. This return can be thought of as the amount one dollar would have changed if it was invested at the same time as a first deposit.</p>
<p>The time-weighted return is unaffected by deposits to and withdrawals from an account, and allows for easy assessment of clients’ investments, and a fair comparison with other investments.</div></div>

<p>Steve is a serial entrepreneur within the wealth advisory industry. In 1994 Lockshin founded Convergent Wealth Advisors (formerly CMS Financial Services) and served as CEO for 18 years, and resigned his daily duties to become Chairman in 2012. Under his leadership the company became one of the largest wealth advisory firms, perennially recognized as a top RIA to the ultra-affluent. Steve has been ranked #1 by Barron’s in their state (CA) and national rankings in numerous periods.</p>
<p>Steve was also an influencer in the technology side of the industry. In 1995, while developing what became Convergent, Steve founded CMS Reporting; now known as Fortigent, LLC, a leading provider of outsourced wealth management and reporting solutions. Fortigent was acquired by LPL Financial Holdings, Inc. in 2012.</p>
<p>Since turning over the reins as CEO of Convergent, Lockshin has focused his efforts on serving as a champion for the fiduciary standard. In September 2013, his book Get Wise to Your Advisor was published and offers investors insight to find a capable advisor who will put the client&#8217;s financial well-being first. Lockshin holds the Investment Management Consultants Association&#8217;s Certified Investment Management Analyst designation and the Investment Strategist Certificate.</p>
<p>Steve still serves many of his clients through his newest RIA venture, AdvicePeriod, while also playing an active role at Betasmartz Institutional where he is focused on enabling advisors to more efficiently operate their businesses and better serve their clients.</p>

<p>Marty founded Mariner in 2006 with a team of just seven other individuals and $300 million in assets under management. Since then, he has led the firm as it has grown to over $35 billion in assets and 440 associates and has gained recognition for his industry leadership by being nationally ranked #2 on Barron’s list of the Top 100 Independent Wealth Advisors for 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>Marty’s vision of fostering an industry-leading, national wealth advisory firm focused on helping clients achieve their goals has led to multiple acquisitions of advisory firms that share his vision, as well as the inception of multiple firms specifically focused on solving client challenges. His leadership has resulted in a firm comprised of industry-leading professionals providing a wide range of services, including, but not limited to: wealth advice and financial planning, asset management, trust and estate planning, retirement planning, investment banking and advisory services, tax consulting, insurance consulting, and more.</p>
<p>As a recognized leader in the field of financial problem-solving for companies and their executives, Marty has been a valuable resource for other successful entrepreneurs, including supporting efforts with the development of Betasmartz Institutional.</p>
